This is basicaly a game where a div of 4 set container is given.Light flashes in one div and when you clicked on div correctly it adds it to your score and then make another container flash.Now the catch is when you are going to increase div you have to learn the count of each div and click all the privious div .Ultimate aim of this game is to sharp your mind and to make merorizing power good.


Now In this game we have used tech part such as:

        event listner 
        if else
        style manipulation
        adding new container in the document**
